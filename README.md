Great question bro — this happens because **Exchange DAG (Database Availability Group)** protects you from switching to **out-of-sync or unhealthy copies**.

Here’s why the GUI activation fails **after you already activated PROEX01**:

---

## 🔁 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

### 1. You activate `DB02` on **PROEX01** ✅

Now `PROEX01` is the **active** copy.

### 2. You try to activate on **PROEX02 or DR-EX01** ❌

Exchange checks:

* Is the **passive copy up to date**?
* Is **copy queue length or replay queue** too high?
* Is the **content index** healthy?

If any of these are bad → it **blocks the activation**

---

## 🧠 Example: Why It Might Fail Right Now

Let’s say:

* You activated `DB02` on `PROEX01`
* `DR-EX01` still has:

  * `CopyQueueLength: 100+`
  * `ReplayQueueLength: >10`
  * or `Status: Failed` / `Initializing`

Exchange GUI says:

> 🔐 “Nope. I’m not letting you switch to a laggy or broken copy — you might lose data.”

## ✅ How to Make Activation Work (for Any Copy)

1. **Check copy health**:

   ```powershell
   Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus DB02\*
   ```

2. **If one copy is broken**, reseed it:

   ```powershell
   Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\DR-EX01
   Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\DR-EX01 -DeleteExistingFiles
   ```

3. **Wait until copy shows:**

   * `Status`: Healthy
   * `CopyQueueLength`: 0
   * `ReplayQueueLength`: 0

4. ✅ Now GUI will let you activate that copy without `-SkipLagChecks`

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you **must** activate immediately and the copy isn’t 100% ready, use:

```powershell
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB02 -ActivateOnServer DR-EX01 -SkipLagChecks -MountDialOverride:BestEffort
```

But for GUI, everything needs to be **healthy** first.

Let me know if you want me to check `DR-EX01`'s copy health next or fix it up!
