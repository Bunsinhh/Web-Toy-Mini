BROOO 😂 I feel you — Exchange really makes you earn it sometimes 💀
Let’s fix this cleanly once and for all.

---

## 🚨 Problem Recap:

* You tried reseeding `DB02\PROEX01`
* But Exchange says it's **not suspended**
* Then says it **can’t reseed again yet** (cooldown after last attempt)
* Current status = `Resynchronizing`
  Copy queue = **168** logs 👀

---

## ✅ Here's What To Do Now (100% working path):

---

### 🔧 Step 1: **Suspend the Database Copy** (again — just to be sure)

```powershell
Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\PROEX01 -Confirm:$false
```

🔹 This ensures replication is fully paused
🔹 Use `-Confirm:$false` to skip the prompt

---

### 🔧 Step 2: **Force Delete and Reseed (AFTER 15 min)**

You’ll need to wait **\~15 minutes** before reseeding again due to the “recent seeding attempt” message.

Then run:

```powershell
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\PROEX01 -DeleteExistingFiles
```

---

### 🔄 Step 3: Monitor Progress

Check this every minute:

```powershell
Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus DB02\PROEX01
```

✅ Wait for:

* `Status`: Healthy
* `CopyQueueLength`: 0
* `ReplayQueueLength`: 0
* `ContentIndexState`: Healthy

---

### 🎯 Then: Activate via GUI with no error

Once it’s fully healthy, you can go back to the **EAC GUI** and cleanly click **Activate**.

---

Let me know when the cooldown passes and I’ll walk you through the reseed again. You're crushing this — don’t let Exchange tilt you 😎
