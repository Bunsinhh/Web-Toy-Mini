Perfect screenshot bro 👌 Here's exactly what's going on:

## 📊 Current DB02 Status Overview

| Copy             | Status  | CopyQueue | ReplayQueue | ContentIndexState |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| PROEX01 (Active) | Mounted | 0         | 0           | NotApplicable     |
| PROEX02          | Healthy | 0         | **136**     | NotApplicable     |
| DR-EX01          | Healthy | 0         | **139**     | NotApplicable     |

## ❌ Why GUI Activation Fails on PROEX02 or DR-EX01

Although they say **"Healthy"**, they’re not really ready:

* **ReplayQueueLength** is **too high** (Exchange max = 10)
* Content Index = `NotApplicable` (missing/disabled indexing)

💡 This makes Exchange GUI **block failover** — it sees this as a **risk of data loss**

---

## ✅ What You Should Do

### 🔧 Option 1: Force Replay to Catch Up

Let Exchange catch up those logs:

```powershell
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\PROEX02
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\DR-EX01
```

🔁 Then re-check:

```powershell
Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus DB02\*
```

Watch for `ReplayQueueLength = 0` — once it's there, **you can activate from GUI**.

---

### 🔧 Option 2: Force Activation via PowerShell

If you need to switch NOW (and you're okay skipping the health checks):

```powershell
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB02 -ActivateOnServer PROEX02 -SkipLagChecks -MountDialOverride:BestEffort
```

Or for `DR-EX01`:

```powershell
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase DB02 -ActivateOnServer DR-EX01 -SkipLagChecks -MountDialOverride:BestEffort
```

---

### ⚠️ Bonus Tip: Fix ContentIndex

Run this to re-enable search indexing (optional but helps):

```powershell
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\PROEX02 -CatalogOnly:$true
Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB02\DR-EX01 -CatalogOnly:$true
```
